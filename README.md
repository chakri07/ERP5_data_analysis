# Proposals
My ideas for my final project are...

Project idea #1:
I would like to do a data analytics project on the stock market using a strategy known as ERP5.
Implement ERP5 trading strategy and back test it.
ERP5 is a ratio calculated on four factors.
Earnings Yield
Return on invested capital (ROIC)
Price to Book and
5 year average ROIC.
Each company is given a ranking according to these ratios, the sum of the ranking is what is considered. The companies with the least sum is what we are interested in the most.
